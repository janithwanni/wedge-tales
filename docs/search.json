Hence any computation that needs to be done will most likely either be done on Javascript or a separate API written in either R or Python.\n\n\nTo run the application locally, node and npm must be installed. For further information on setting up node and npm check out this link here.\nAfter installing node and npm, run npm install on the base folder to setup the packages for Svelte. The application can be run after setting up the packages by running the command npm run dev. To get the Mapbox tiles to work a .env file needs to be created containing the authentication token for Mapbox. Contact the maintainers of this repo for a key or use your own key as needed."
